# Cacke recipe
This recipe makes one single-layer cake, perfect for a small group.
You can frost it or just dust it with powdered sugar.


## Preparation

Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour an 8-inch round
cake pan or an 8x8 inch square pan.


## Ingredients
   - 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
   - 1 cup granulated sugar
   - 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
   - ½ teaspoon salt
   - ⅓ cup vegetable oil (or melted butter, cooled)
   - 1 large egg
   - ¾ cup milk (any kind)
   - 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

## Instructions
  Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Stir with a spoon or spatula until just combined. 
  Don't overmix! A few small lumps are okay. Overmixing makes a tough cake.
